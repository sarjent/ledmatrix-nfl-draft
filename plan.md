I want to make a plugin for the LEDMatrix project that shows the projected nfl players draft using data from espn.  The data should refresh daily. 

the font size, color and font should be user configurable.

The NFL Team Logo should appear to the left of the players name.  Use the NFL Scoreboard as reference to find the location of the NFL Team logos. 

The projected draft pick number should appear to the right of the players name in white color font

The display should scroll through the entire first round.  You can use the Oddsticker plugin for reference on scrolling settings

When the NFL Draft occurs, the plugin should show real time draft pick information for the current round only.  Draft data refresh for live data should be every 10 minutes during the NFL Draft.  We only want to display data from rounds 1, 2 and 3 by default but should be user configurable to select from single or multiple rounds using a comma seperated text input field. example 1,2,3 or 1 or all (to display the entire draft)
